This bundles your files to the distribution (`/dist`) folder. The webpack config is set up to output Phaser and your game code into separate .js files.

_If you are publishing your game to [itch.io](https://itch.io) simply zip up the files in the `/dist` folder and upload the zip file._

## Community

This repository is actively maintained. Every so often I upgrade the packages and add features. I like boilerplates to be light so I have kept it minimal. But if you think this package would benefit from additional features then feel free to reach out or add an issue.
